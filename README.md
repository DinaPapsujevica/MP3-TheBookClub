# The Book Club

Milestone Project 3 - Python and Data Centric Development

The website is created with the purpose to motivate people to read more books and share their opinions about the books they read.
The site will be targeted at the people who love to read books and people who doubt what to read.
Nowadays there is a huge choice of books for different ages, interests, and topics. Any one of us can get confused in this sea of books.
That is why book review and recommendation sites are here to help solve it. 
Existing user book reviews will help to choose and understand which could be your next book to read.
